Eido-Flora

Short description
Eido-Flora replaces vanilla vegetation with a collection of handcrafted custom plants and flora to enrich Minecraft's biomes. Designed to be compatible with terrain-generation mods and easy to extend.

Features
- Replaces vanilla plants with custom models and textures
- Data-driven worldgen features (NBT-based structures for trees and grouped plants)
- Many plant blocks, items and behaviors (watering pot, growth tweaks, bonemeal adjustments)
- Localization in English and French
- Compatible with Neoforge and common worldgen mods

Compatibility & Requirements
- Neoforge / Minecraft mod loader compatible with the project's metadata
- Recommended Java version: see project Gradle setup (use the same JDK used to build the mod)
- Works with most terrain-generation mods but may need configuration for edge cases

Installation
1. Download the mod jar from the project release and place it in your `mods/` folder.
2. Ensure you run the correct Minecraft/Neoforge version supported by the mod.
3. Optional: copy the `data/eidoplants/` datapack into the world's `datapacks/` folder for custom worldgen tweaks.

Quick start for developers
- Build with Gradle (using the included wrapper):
  .\gradlew.bat build
- Run the client in the dev environment (if configured):
  .\gradlew.bat runClient

Where to edit
- Code: `src/main/java/fr/Eidolyth/` (mod entry points, blocks, items, worldgen, plants)
- Resources: `src/main/resources/assets/eidoplants/` (blockstates, models, textures, lang)
- Datapack & worldgen: `src/main/resources/data/eidoplants/` (worldgen, structures, recipes, tags)

Troubleshooting
- Check `run/` for run profiles, `crash-reports/` and `logs/` if Minecraft crashes.
- Make sure you use the same Java major version as the project (see `gradle.properties` / build files).

Contributing
- Create a dedicated branch for each feature or bugfix.
- Follow the project's `doc/gitSyntax.md` for commit messages and PR practices.
- Submit a pull request for review.
